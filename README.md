The Weight Tracker mobile application was designed to be a place for users to track their daily weight. The app's requirements were a screen for users to log in and 
create new accounts, a database to store user accounts and a table for the daily weights on specific dates, and SMS messaging notifications when permitted by the 
user.  This app was designed with the goal in mind that different types of users would use it in their way. Some users might be parents tracking their kids’ weight, 
another user might be a personal trainer tracking each of their clients’ weight, and another user might be an individual tracking their weight during the weight 
loss, weight gain, or weight maintenance journey. 

Specific screens and features were necessary to support these user needs. There is a login screen where the user can log in or sign up. If the user is new and signs 
up, they must also provide a phone number. On this screen, there were two buttons, login and signup. This allowed the user to be transitioned to the next screen. 
The main screen was necessary to provide the user with a personalized view of the app. The main screen holds their daily weight and allows them to add weight. They 
can edit their weight or delete it on specific dates.

Before coding, I processed what screens I would need and how a user would need to get from screen to screen. I decided on the different XML and JAVA files I would 
need. Then I created the XML file, created the screen how I wanted it to look, and then coded the java file to implement it. Before creating these files, writing 
the different user needs and requirements of the application helped determine the steps I needed to take. In the future, I will always write down the 
application's requirements, goals, and user needs before jumping into the creation of code. 

By testing the application, we can determine how our app looks to the user and if there are any flaws. Using the Android Emulator, testing the app made the 
process easier. This is important as the developer, you can see how the app will look to the user. It brings up any issues they may have and insight into fixing 
them. I noticed my app wasn’t showing up in the emulator, and it was a process to fix it.

The hardest part was determining why the application would not appear in the emulator. I had to research how to fix this issue to overcome it. Many of the 
challenges I encountered were resolved by researching the issue. There are many developers that have had the same issue and have asked how to resolve it in places 
like stack overflow. One challenge I noticed was that sometimes Android Studio would act as though I couldn’t name my id’s, and I simply had to close out and open 
it back up. 

With this mobile application, I was successful in the coding of the java files and transitioning between screens. I enjoy the java coding language, and it 
demonstrates my knowledge in coding. This is my first mobile application, so it shows my capability to learn new things in the IT world.
